**README.md for AirBnB Clone Project**

**Project Description**

This project is a console-based clone of the AirBnB website. It allows users to create, manage, and search for AirBnB listings.

**Command Interpreter**

The command interpreter can be started by running the following command:

```
./console.py
```

Once the command interpreter is running, users can type in commands to interact with the application. For example, to create a new AirBnB listing, users would type the following command:

```
create listing
```

The command interpreter would then prompt the user for information about the listing, such as the title, description, and location. Once the user has entered all of the required information, the command interpreter would create a new listing and assign it a unique identifier.

To search for AirBnB listings, users would type the following command:

```
search listing <query>
```

The command interpreter would then display a list of all AirBnB listings that match the query.

**Examples**

Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

```
# Create a new listing
create listing
Title: My Awesome Listing
Description: This is a great place to stay in San Francisco!
Location: San Francisco, CA

# Search for listings in San Francisco
search listing San Francisco

# Display information about a listing
show listing 12345678-90ab-cdef-ghij-klmnopqrstuvwxyz

# Update a listing
update listing 12345678-90ab-cdef-ghij-klmnopqrstuvwxyz
Title: My Even More Awesome Listing
Description: This is now the best place to stay in San Francisco!

# Delete a listing
delete listing 12345678-90ab-cdef-ghij-klmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
